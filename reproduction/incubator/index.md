Snails are **hermaphrodites**. However, they still need a mate to repopulate. On the incubator page, you can either
* Register as a male and donate your genome to the Gene Market.
* Register as a female and select to buy a genome from the Gene Market to start breeding.

In each incubation period, a snail can change its registered gender. However, once it is selected, it cannot change its gender preference until the next incubation period.
!!!

Owners can incubate their snails once a month. In each incubation period:
* A male can donate a genome once. Donated genomes can be sold three times on the Gene Market. 
  * After the genome donation, there will be a 30-day cooldown period before the next one starts.
* A female can lay eggs once. The eggs hatch 1 day after incubation. 99.9% of the time only one snail hatches from an egg, but with a 0.1% chance, there might be twins.
    * After fertilization, there will be a 30-day cooldown period before the next one starts.

Generated from at least 5 snails.
At least 2 out of the 5 snails must be available to breed in that month.

#### Does an evolved snail have to wait for incubation?
If the snail did not use its breeding right for the current cycle, then it can incubate in the current cycle.
