Snails can belong to one of 5 different families.
* Each family has a different letter assigned for its gene.
* Each snail has 20 genes in its genome. The most dominant gene determines its family.
* Both parents randomly pass on 10 genes to the offspring's genetic sequence.
* While the quantity of genes is important for reproduction, its order in the genetic sequence is not.

**Genesis Snails** have the following genetic sequence:

| Family   | Gene | Genesis Genome                             | Random Gene Pool |
|----------|------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Atlantis | X    | 11X + 2A   + 1M   + 1H   + 1G   + 4 Random | A, M, H, G       |
| Agate    | A    | 1X   + 11A + 2M   + 1H   + 1G   + 4 Random | X, M, H, G       |
| Milk     | M    | 1X   + 1A   + 11M + 2H   + 1G   + 4 Random | X, A, H, G       |
| Helix    | H    | 1X   + 1A   + 1M   + 11H + 2G   + 4 Random | X, A, M, G       |
| Garden   | G    | 2X   + 1A   + 1M   + 1H   + 11G + 4 Random | X, A, M, H       |

Family genes are ordered from recessive to dominant which means **Atlantis (X)** is the rarest one while **Garden (G)** is the most common. Even though Genesis Genomes are not purebred, snails might evolve into purebreds through the reproduction process if they have 20 times the same gene. 


#### If an offspring snail receives the two most common genes, which family would it belong to?
The snail will belong to the family which has the most dominant gene. Let's take a look at an example. If a snail has a 4X + 4A + 4M + 4H + 4G distribution in its genome, then it will belong to the Garden(G).
