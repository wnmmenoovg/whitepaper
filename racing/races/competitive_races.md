#### How many races can a snail participate at the same time?
There is not any limit on participation.


#### Which currency will be used for entering races? 
For entering races that have fees, you will require native-token in your wallet.

#### Will I be able to control my snail?
No. Your snail will race based on its traits. Genes, class, generation and adaptations of your snail affect its speed. Also your snails performance will change based on trail distances and trail conditions. You have to experiment with your snail to find perfect trails to optimize the results.
