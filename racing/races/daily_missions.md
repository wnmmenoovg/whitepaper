#### Can I join same mission with more than one snails?
No. If you enter a mission with one of your snails, you will not be able to participate the same mission with another snail.

#### Will I be able to control my snail?
No. Your snail will race based on its traits. Genes, class, generation and adaptations of your snail affect its speed. Also your snails performance will change based on trail distances and trail conditions. You have to experiment with your snail to find perfect tracks to optimize the results.
