There are several available tracks to race. A track differs from others in the distance and conditions.

---
## Distance
In the real world, an average snail moves at a 1m/h speed. Obviously, the Snail Trail Slider Committee would not accept such a low performance on races. In Snail Trail, there are 9 different trail distances. Race distances are in meters.

* Each snail has two preferred racing distances. An owner should test a snail on different trails to find its true potential.
* Each trail consists of 10 sectors.

---

## Conditions
Each track will have three conditions that can be countered with snails' adaptations.
* Conditions are generated randomly for each race from each [Adaptation](../snails/racing_traits/adaptation.md) category.

## Map Themes

There are six different location themes planned for trails.
* Garden
    * Good old garden! Are you ready, Garden Snails?!
* Dirt
  * The ground is much better if it's a little bit moist!
* Road
  * Rrrrring rrrrring, watch out for bikes!
* Beach
  * You know what seawater's like, right? It... is... salty.
* Glass
  * The easiest way to slide. Just slide away!
* Space
  * Keep your eyes peeled! You might encounter snailiens out there. 

!!!info Themes 
For the launch only **Garden** themed map will be available. Other visuals will be introduced with a later patch.

## Location
Each race track will have a event location for users to differantiate them in the race board. It is purely cosmetic.
